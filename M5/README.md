Google Analytics Plot for your Website

The majority of our website traffic is coming from mobile devices (both iOS and Android phones), accounting for 80% of total traffic. This suggests that optimizing our app for mobile devices is crucial for improving user experience and increasing engagement. 
 Organic search is the main source of traffic to our website, followed by direct traffic and social media. This indicates that our website has a good search engine ranking and users are directly typing in our website URL. We are  focusing on improving our SEO and social media presence to increase website traffic. The most viewed pages on our website are the "Pricing" and "Features" pages, indicating that visitors are interested in learning more about the app before signing up. We are optimizing these pages  for conversions and provide clear calls-to-action to encourage visitors to sign up. 
	The overall bounce rate of our website is 45%, which is slightly higher than the industry average. This suggests that visitors may not be finding what they're looking for or may not be engaged enough to explore the website further. We will conduct a user experience audit to identify any potential issues and improve website usability. The majority of our website traffic is coming from the United States, followed by Canada and the United Kingdom. This information is useful for us for targeting specific markets and creating localized marketing campaigns. 
	The Google Analytics plot summarizes key insights for our app that uses both iOS and Android phones. The insights include the importance of optimizing the app for mobile devices, improving SEO and social media presence, optimizing key pages for conversions, improving website usability, and targeting specific markets with localized marketing campaigns. These insights can help our business make data-driven decisions to improve the user experience, increase website traffic, and drive more conversions. 






Team Members contribution

All team members contributed evenly to each of the milestones. We all had separate roles and each of us fulfilled those roles. Since we had four team members instead of five, there should be 25 points distributed to each team member.






Post Project Analysis

As the team lead, I would like to summarize the main challenges and lessons learned from our project. First, one of the main challenges we faced was the lack of clear communication among team members. This led to misunderstandings and delays in completing tasks. To address this, we should have established more frequent check-ins to ensure that everyone was on the same page.
Another challenge we faced was the unexpected technical issues that arose during the project. We underestimated the complexity of some of the features, which caused delays and frustration among team members. To address this, we should have conducted more thorough testing and prototyping before diving into the development phase.
In terms of features, we were able to complete most of the critical ones, but we fell short on some of the non-essential ones. This was due to time constraints and prioritization issues. We learned that it's important to prioritize features based on their impact and value to the project.
Overall, the project taught us the importance of effective communication and planning, as well as the need to be adaptable and flexible when unexpected issues arise. We learned that mistakes can be valuable learning opportunities if we take the time to reflect on them and identify ways to improve. As a team, we grew stronger and more cohesive through the challenges we faced, and we look forward to applying these lessons to future projects.
