5. Overview, scenarios and use cases

This reminder app is intended to help users remember important events, tasks, and Important things that the users want to save daily. For example, a college student will use this app in different scenarios such as remembering an assignment, remembering a doctor's appointment, remembering a particular task from work, remembering to buy something from the store, or maybe make a phone call to check on their parents or partner. This college student will take out his or her phone to type a message and set a time and date for the reminder and then continue with his day until the task is completed. This college student does not need to have any skill other than knowing how to use a mobile phone to set reminders in the app. Besides that, it does not require any specific skill.

6. High-level functional requirements

	1. Allow users to create multiple reminder lists for different purposes: This requirement allows users to create and organize their reminders into separate lists based on different categories such as work, personal, fitness, etc. This helps users keep their reminders organized and easy to manage.
	2.	Provide a range of customization options for each reminder: Users need the ability to customize their reminders as per their needs. This includes setting a specific date and time, location, repeating frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly), and priority level. This ensures that users receive reminders at the right time and with the right frequency.
	3.	Allow users to categorize their reminders using tags or labels: This requirement allows users to add tags or labels to their reminders for easy sorting and filtering. For example, users can add the "work" tag to their work-related reminders, and the
"personal" tag to their personal reminders.
	4.	Provide various reminder types: Users may prefer different types of reminders, such as simple notifications, sound alarms, or vibration. Providing multiple reminder types helps users choose the most appropriate type for their specific needs.

8. High-level system architecture and database organization

1)	Our mobile reminder app uses Node.js and Express, two very popular tools in the JavaScript ecosystem.
Node.js provides an event driven model which makes it very light weight and efficient.
Express on the other hand, is a web application framework that simplifies the process of building APIs and web applications.
The integration of both allows our application to handle requests and responses efficiently, which in turn makes it fast and responsive.
Additionally, the usage of JavaScript for both the client and server side reduces development time and simplifies code maintenance. 
  Programming languages:
  
   1.Javascript
   
   2.CSS
   
   3.HTML
   
  Tools:
  
   1.Git
   
   2.Github
   
   3.Visual Studio Code
   
  Supported Browsers:
  
   1.Google chrome
   
   2.Safari
   
   3.Microsoft edge
  2)	The main DB schema has two main tables, one for the email and password of each user so each person can have their private remainders on their account both fields are required. The second main table is the one for the events, an event is required to have a title, priority, and time attribute, in addition, a user has the option to add data like a description of the reminder, and location for where the event will occur. Then we have a dependent table that will inherit the values of the event table called recurrent events, which will have an extra attribute for the schedule in which the event is expected to be repeated. This dependent table is a subdivision of a main table, and the schedule attribute is a required field.
 3)	RememberAll app is expected to keep data like GPS data and locations stored to help users remember events or actions that they need to do when they are at specific locations. This data needs to be saved in the DB because we need to keep track of special locations.
 
 4)	The algorithm will search for specific fields like time, and location since events are either needed at a specific time or in a special location. The DB will be sorted by either priority (most likely) or by time. 


  5)	Core APIs:
  
   1.Google Maps API
   
   2.Stripe API
   
   3.OpenWeatherMap API
