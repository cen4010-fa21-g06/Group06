2.4 QA test plan: function Geolocation.
1)	Test objectives: The objectives for RememberAll software QA test is to check if the web app can keep track of the user events and important tasks of the user. Also to make a general test of all the functions like add, delete, get recurrent events, sort events by priority or time, and Geo location. 
This Test will check if RememberAll recognizes when the user is near a location where the user has added an event and send a notification to remind the user about the event or things that it has to do.
2)	Hardware and software setup: max 0.5 page
RememberAll hardware setup: for RememberAll web application is needed any device capable of connecting to the internet, GPS, and any browser that supports JavaScript.  
RememberAll software setup can be accessed through a website, SQL Database setup, and JavaScript environment. 
3)	Feature to be tested: max 0.5 page
For the QA test, we will be going over the Geolocation feature, which is expected to recognize when the user is in or near a location that has been registered in any of the events. 
For example, if the user goes to a grocery store RememberAll will send a notification to the user letting him know that he has a list of items to buy, and it will display a checklist to make sure that the user has completed his shopping. If the user, is only nearby then it will send a notification asking the user if he wants to stop and complete this task and create a list to go over it.
 This feature will use GPS, notification to the user, and a snooze option to check the location again if the user wants to come back later, a timely reminder.  

4)	Actual test cases: 3 test cases and results of testing them on your system: 1 page
1.	Pop up a checklist of items to buy when the user is in a grocery store.
2.	When a user passes near a pharmacy ask the user if he wants to stop and buy the medicine that he needs. If the user selects no, delay until a specific time or the next time he passes by a pharmacy. 
3.	 If the user passes near a UPS store the RememberAll web app will send a notification reminding the user to collect a package.
